With frequencies close together (e.g., 440 Hz and 443 Hz), this alternation creates a pulsating loudness change - the beat frequency equals the difference (3 Hz in this example). Musicians use beats to tune instruments precisely."

In blind tests, most listeners cannot reliably distinguish the two tunings. That said, 432 Hz is a valid artistic choice - many historical compositions were performed at lower pitches."

                <p><strong>Sine waves</strong> contain only the fundamental frequency - the purest possible tone with no harmonics. They sound smooth and clean, often described as "pure" or "hollow."</p>
                <p><strong>Square waves</strong> add odd harmonics (3rd, 5th, 7th...) at decreasing amplitudes (1/3, 1/5, 1/7...). This creates a hollow, buzzy sound reminiscent of clarinets or vintage synthesizers.</p>
                <p><strong>Sawtooth waves</strong> contain ALL harmonics (both odd and even) at amplitudes of 1/n. This produces the brightest, most harmonically rich sound - similar to brass instruments or aggressive synth leads.</p>
                <p><strong>Triangle waves</strong> have odd harmonics like square waves, but they decrease much faster (1/n squared). The result is softer and more mellow - somewhere between sine and square.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>When a physical object vibrates (string, air column, membrane), it typically vibrates at multiple frequencies simultaneously - not just the fundamental pitch you perceive.</p>
                <p><strong>Harmonics</strong> are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. If the fundamental is 100 Hz, harmonics occur at 200 Hz (2nd), 300 Hz (3rd), 400 Hz (4th), and so on.</p>
                <p><strong>Overtones</strong> refer to any frequency above the fundamental, whether harmonic or not. Bells and drums have inharmonic overtones (not integer multiples), giving them their distinctive metallic or percussive quality.</p>
                <p>The relative strengths of harmonics determine <strong>timbre</strong> - why a violin and flute playing the same note sound different.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Hz (Hertz)</strong> is the unit of frequency, measuring cycles per second. Named after physicist Heinrich Hertz, it tells you how many complete wave oscillations occur each second.</p>
                <p><strong>kHz (kilohertz)</strong> equals 1,000 Hz. It's used for higher frequencies to avoid large numbers.</p>
                <p>Examples:<br>
                - 20 Hz = very low bass (near the limit of hearing)<br>
                - 440 Hz = A above middle C (concert pitch)<br>
                - 1 kHz = 1,000 Hz (common test frequency)<br>
                - 20 kHz = 20,000 Hz (upper limit of human hearing)</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Beating</strong> is an interference phenomenon. When two waves are close in frequency, they alternately reinforce and cancel each other as they drift in and out of phase.</p>
                <p>The beat rate equals the frequency difference. If you play 440 Hz and 443 Hz together, you'll hear 3 beats per second (the loudness pulses 3 times per second).</p>
                <p>Musicians use beating to tune instruments. When two notes are perfectly in tune (or in a perfect interval), the beating stops. Piano tuners listen to beat rates to set equal temperament precisely.</p>
                <p>Above about 20 Hz difference, beating becomes too fast to perceive as separate pulses and instead creates a sensation of roughness or dissonance.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>A440</strong> means the note A above middle C (A4) vibrates at exactly 440 Hz. This has been the international standard for concert pitch since ISO 16 was adopted in 1955.</p>
                <p>The choice of 440 Hz was a compromise. Historical concert pitch varied widely (from about 400 Hz to 460 Hz). As orchestras traveled internationally, standardization became necessary for practical coordination.</p>
                <p>Today, many European orchestras tune slightly higher - 442 Hz (some German orchestras) or 443 Hz (Vienna Philharmonic) - for a brighter, more projecting sound. Baroque ensembles often use A = 415 Hz (approximately one semitone lower) for historical authenticity.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The nominal human hearing range is <strong>20 Hz to 20,000 Hz</strong> (20 kHz), but this varies significantly:</p>
                <p><strong>Low frequency limit (~20 Hz):</strong> Below about 20 Hz, we feel vibration rather than perceive pitch. Individual sensitivity varies - some people can hear down to 16-18 Hz in quiet conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>High frequency limit:</strong> This declines with age (presbycusis). Children may hear up to 20 kHz; by age 40-50, most people lose sensitivity above 14-16 kHz; by 60+, the limit may be 8-10 kHz.</p>
                <p><strong>Peak sensitivity:</strong> Human hearing is most sensitive around 2-4 kHz - the speech-critical frequency range.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Equal temperament</strong> is the modern Western tuning system that divides the octave into 12 equal semitones. Each semitone is exactly the 12th root of 2 (approximately 1.0595), so 12 semitones equal exactly one octave (2:1 ratio).</p>
                <p>This system allows music to be played in any key with equal effect, at the cost of slightly detuning pure intervals. In equal temperament:</p>
                <p>- Perfect fifths are 2 cents narrow (698 cents instead of 702 cents)<br>
                - Major thirds are 14 cents wide (400 cents instead of 386 cents)<br>
                - Only octaves are perfectly pure</p>
                <p>Before equal temperament, various "well temperaments" and "just intonation" systems were used, each with different compromises.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p><strong>Cents</strong> are a logarithmic unit for measuring pitch intervals. One semitone equals 100 cents, so one octave equals 1200 cents.</p>
                <p>The cent is defined as 1/1200 of an octave, or a frequency ratio of 2^(1/1200) ≈ 1.00058.</p>
                <p>This system is useful because:</p>
                <p>- It's consistent across the frequency range (unlike Hz, which varies with register)<br>
                - Small pitch differences are easily expressed (e.g., "5 cents sharp")<br>
                - It matches musical perception (equal-sounding intervals = equal cent differences)</p>
                <p>Most trained musicians can perceive pitch differences of 5-10 cents; highly trained ears may detect 2-3 cents under ideal conditions.</p>

                <p>- 432 is not a harmonic of the Schumann frequency (7.83 Hz)<br>
                - Controlled water crystallization claims have not been replicated<br>

                <p><strong>Yes, if used at excessive volumes.</strong> Any sound above 85 dB can cause hearing damage with prolonged exposure. Pure tones can be particularly fatiguing.</p>
                <p><strong>Safety guidelines:</strong></p>
                <p>- Start at low volume and increase gradually<br>
                - Take breaks every 15-20 minutes<br>

                <span>Why does sound quality seem to change at different volumes?</span>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>This is due to <strong>equal loudness contours</strong> (Fletcher-Munson curves). Human hearing is not equally sensitive across all frequencies - we're most sensitive around 3-4 kHz and much less sensitive to bass frequencies.</p>
                <p>At low volumes, bass and treble seem to disappear, leaving mostly midrange. At higher volumes, the frequency response "flattens" and you hear fuller bass and more treble.</p>
                <p>This is why:</p>
                <p>- "Loudness" buttons on stereos boost bass and treble at low volumes<br>
                - Music sounds "fuller" when played loud<br>
                - Mixing engineers work at consistent, calibrated levels<br>
                - You may need to boost bass for quiet late-night listening</p>

                <span>Why can't I hear very high frequencies?</span>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Several factors affect high-frequency audibility:</p>
                <p><strong>Age:</strong> High-frequency hearing naturally declines. By age 40, many people cannot hear above 15 kHz; by 60, the limit may be 8-10 kHz.</p>
                <p><strong>Noise exposure:</strong> Prior exposure to loud sounds damages the delicate hair cells that detect high frequencies.</p>
                <p><strong>Equipment:</strong> Many speakers and headphones roll off above 15-18 kHz. Check your equipment specifications.</p>
                <p><strong>Volume:</strong> High frequencies may simply be too quiet. The tone generator produces equal electrical amplitude across frequencies, but your equipment may not reproduce them equally.</p>
                <p>If you're concerned about high-frequency hearing loss, consult an audiologist for proper testing.</p>
